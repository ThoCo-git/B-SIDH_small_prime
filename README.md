# B-SIDH_small_prime
## This is an assembly of functions to perform field arithmetic in a finite field F_(p^2), elliptic curve arithmetic and degree 3, 4, and 7 isogeny computation.
## It is implemented for p=127, but can easily be adapted to other small prime numbers.
## It provides all necessary function to perform a walk in the supersingular isogeny graph, as described in Costello's work "B-SIDH: supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman using twisted torsion"
